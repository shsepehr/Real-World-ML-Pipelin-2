#  Real-World Machine Learning Pipeline

An end-to-end **Machine Learning pipeline** built to simulate a real-world workflow — from raw data ingestion to automated preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model deployment output. This project demonstrates how a clean and production-style ML structure can streamline data science projects and make them scalable for real applications.

##  Key Features

-  **Data Ingestion** — Load raw CSV input and inspect dataset structure  
-  **Preprocessing Pipeline** — Handle missing values, encoding, scaling  
-  **Feature Engineering** — Custom domain feature generation (ex: `salary_per_age`)  
-  **Supervised Learning** — Train a ML model using Scikit-Learn  
-  **Model Evaluation** — Accuracy score + train/test split validation  
-  **Model Saving** — Export trained model as `.joblib` for future predictions  
-  **Modular Project Structure** — Production-style separation of concerns  

## 🗂️ Project Structure


##  Dataset Format

The pipeline expects **these exact column names** in your CSV:

| Column Name   | Type      | Description |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| `age`         | numeric   | Person's age |
| `salary`      | numeric   | Salary value |
| `department`  | category  | Department label for encoding |
| `target`      | numeric/0-1 | Model prediction target |

### Example `raw_data.csv`

```csv
age,salary,department,target
25,3000,IT,1
32,4500,HR,0
41,5200,Finance,1
29,3800,IT,0
